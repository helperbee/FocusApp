# Intention
Limiting potential procrastination by tracking & controlling App usage. Leveraging the power of the Window's API, I'll be able to see how much time I've spent 'procrastinating' and implement a fix by forcing application focus during alotted periods of work.



# TODO List
- [x] Hook Window Change
- [x] Assign preferred window
- [ ] Enforce preferred window for alotted time
- [ ] Track App Usage
- [ ] Log change attempts during alotted time
- [ ] Overview of sessions
